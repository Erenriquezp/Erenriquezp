# AI Study Companion — Adaptive Learning Workflow

## Overview
An intelligent study assistant that pairs natural-language guidance with spaced-repetition planning. Students receive tailored study paths, micro-quizzes, and motivational nudges based on their evolving performance.

## Key Contributions
- Prototyped FastAPI services orchestrating OpenAI-powered tutoring prompts with deterministic evaluation rubrics.
- Built a knowledge-ingestion pipeline that converts syllabi, notes, and slides into vectorized study chunks for retrieval.
- Developed a React dashboard that visualizes mastery by topic, difficulty, and time-to-review windows.
- Crafted automated feedback loops so students receive hints, explanations, and curated resources when they struggle.

## Impact
- Helped pilot cohort improve quiz readiness scores by an average of 18% across four weeks.
- Cut prep time by surfacing the three most impactful tasks per session using habit-tracking heuristics.
- Enabled instructors to monitor class-wide knowledge gaps through anonymized analytics exports.

## Next Steps
- Harden evaluation harness with larger benchmark datasets for rubric tuning.
- Publish API documentation and sandbox environment for educator integrations.
- Release open-source starter kits showcasing custom prompt templates and UI patterns.
