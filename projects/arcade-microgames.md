# Arcade Microgames Collection — Prototype Breakdown & Learnings

## Overview
A curated set of game jam-scale prototypes exploring combat, platforming, and puzzle mechanics. Each microgame serves as a test bed for gameplay feel, shader experiments, and rapid asset pipelines.

## Key Contributions
- Shipped three distinct gameplay loops (runner, arena brawler, rhythm puzzler) built with reusable Godot systems.
- Authored modular input, camera, and UI layers in C# to accelerate iteration across prototypes.
- Implemented automated build scripts for exporting to Web, Windows, and macOS targets with consistent performance profiles.
- Crafted dynamic post-processing and particle effects to elevate moment-to-moment feedback without sacrificing FPS.

## Impact
- Validated core mechanics that feed into larger commercial concepts currently in pre-production.
- Generated reusable tooling that cut scene setup time by 60% for subsequent prototypes.
- Attracted playtest signups from 200+ players through portfolio showcases and indie community events.

## Next Steps
- Package the reusable systems into a public template for other Godot creators.
- Produce gameplay breakdown videos highlighting iteration strategies and lessons learned.
- Expand the collection with multiplayer experiments leveraging rollback netcode research.
